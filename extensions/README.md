# RivonClaw Extensions

Extensions are OpenClaw plugins that ship with RivonClaw. They are auto-discovered
at runtime — no per-extension wiring needed in config-writer, main.ts, or
electron-builder.yml.

## Extension Inventory

| Extension | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `rivonclaw-policy` | Hook | Injects compiled policies and guard directives into system prompt |
| `rivonclaw-file-permissions` | Hook | Validates file operations against permission policies |
| `rivonclaw-search-browser-fallback` | Hook (single-file) | Falls back to browser search when `web_search` fails |

### Deprecated: rivonclaw-tools

`rivonclaw-tools` was a prompt-prepend extension that told agents not to use the
OpenClaw CLI. It is deprecated and removed because vendor patch 0009 replaces the
upstream CLI guidance directly in OpenClaw's system prompt, avoiding conflicting
system instructions.

## How Loading Works

RivonClaw points `plugins.load.paths` at the **entire `extensions/` directory**.
OpenClaw's `discoverInDirectory()` scans each subdirectory and discovers plugins via:

1. `package.json` with `openclaw.extensions` field (channel plugins)
2. `index.ts` / `index.mjs` fallback (hook plugins like search-browser-fallback)
3. `openclaw.plugin.json` manifest validation (subdirs without it are skipped)

### Dev vs Packaged App

| Environment | Extensions Path |
|---|---|
| Dev (monorepo) | `<monorepo-root>/extensions/` — auto-resolved via `pnpm-workspace.yaml` |
| Packaged Electron | `process.resourcesPath + "/extensions"` — bundled by electron-builder |

The `extensionsDir` option in `writeGatewayConfig()` handles both cases.
`electron-builder.yml` copies all extensions into `Contents/Resources/extensions/`.

## Required Files

Every extension **must** have:

- **`openclaw.plugin.json`** — Plugin manifest with at minimum:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "<plugin-id>",
    "configSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "properties": {}
    }
  }
  ```
  The `id` and `configSchema` fields are **required** by OpenClaw's manifest
  validator. Without `configSchema`, the gateway will crash on startup.

- **An entry point** — Either:
  - `index.ts` (loaded by jiti at runtime, no build step needed)
  - A built `.mjs` referenced in `package.json` `openclaw.extensions`

## Two Extension Patterns

### Pattern A: Single-file hook plugin (no build step)

For simple plugins that intercept/augment tool calls. Example: `search-browser-fallback/`.

```
my-plugin/
  openclaw.plugin.json    # required manifest
  index.ts                # entry point, loaded by jiti
```

No `package.json`, no build, no `node_modules`. The `.ts` file is transpiled
on-the-fly by OpenClaw's jiti loader.

### Pattern B: Channel plugin (built with tsdown)

For channel integrations with dependencies and build output.

```
my-channel/
  openclaw.plugin.json    # required manifest
  package.json            # with openclaw.extensions: ["./openclaw-plugin.mjs"]
  openclaw-plugin.mjs     # built entry point
  openclaw-plugin.ts      # source for the entry point
  src/                    # additional source files
  dist/                   # build output
  tsdown.config.ts        # build config
  vitest.config.ts        # test config
```

The `package.json` `openclaw.extensions` array tells OpenClaw which `.mjs` file(s)
to load. The extension must be built (`pnpm build`) before it can be loaded.

## Checklist: Adding a New Extension

1. Create `extensions/<name>/openclaw.plugin.json` with `id` and `configSchema`
2. Create the entry point (`index.ts` for Pattern A, or `openclaw-plugin.ts` + build for Pattern B)
3. If Pattern B, add the package to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` packages list
4. **No changes needed** in:
   - `packages/gateway/src/config-writer.ts`
   - `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`
   - `apps/desktop/electron-builder.yml`
5. Test in dev: start the app, check gateway logs for plugin discovery
6. Test packaged build: verify the extension appears in `Contents/Resources/extensions/`

## What NOT to Put Here

- **Vendor-bundled plugins** (e.g. `google-gemini-cli-auth`) — These ship inside
  `vendor/openclaw/extensions/` and are enabled via `plugins.entries` only
